# Data Science Remote Assessment

### Challenge 1
Explore the Covid-19 dataset. Plot the month-on-month Covid positive numbers state wise. Display the top 3 states for the month of June.

### Challenge 2
Create two separate but temporally overlapping dummy datasets containing different sensor values each (e.g, temperatures, pressures, etc.).
Merge both datasets, resample it with a meaningful sampling rate and report some basic statistics.

### Challenge 3
What is a fourier transform? Please explain and build an exemplary time series, perform a fourier transform and interpret the results.

### Challenge 4
Explore the aircraft engine operation dataset. Each line depicts aggregated data of one cycle for a total of 100 different engines. 
Build a model which predicts when an engine will fail?
Note: The target variable has to be engineered and is not yet included in the dataset.
